# Caption Generator

## Overview
This project utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing models including BLIP, BERT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 Turbo to generate captions for various types of content such as images, videos, or text snippets.

## Features
- **BLIP Integration**: BLIP (Bidirectional Latent Intents with Transformers) model provides contextual understanding, enhancing the quality of generated captions.
- **BERT Support**: Incorporating BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for fine-tuning and improving the accuracy of generated captions.
- **GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo**: Leveraging the power of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo for natural language generation, ensuring fluent and contextually relevant captions.

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your data, whether it's images, videos, or text, and ensure it's in a compatible format.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model(s) for caption generation based on your requirements and available resources.
4. **Caption Generation**: Utilize the provided scripts or APIs to generate captions for your content.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the generated captions for accuracy, coherence, and relevance. Fine-tune models if necessary.
